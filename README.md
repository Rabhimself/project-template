# Irish General Election 2016, Neo4j Database
###### Robert Bryant, G00317412

## Introduction
This project serves as an introduction to Neo4j, a part of the Graph Theory module. This project was forked from the original project spec and is not part of any ongoing development of software. The project required we design and build a Neo4j database describing the Irish 2016 General Election, as well as provide 3 queries that yield interesting information or insights into the election.

## Database
The database consists of 3 node types; Constituency, Candidate, and Party. The data that was used to populate the database was found on the internet, and was not provided in the project spec. The database focuses more so on meta data rather than the candidates themselves. Party affiliation (particularily in the case of independents) is tied to which party the candidate ran under. For example, if a candidate was a member of an Independent organization, but did not run under the organization's name, the candidate is listed as an Independent rather than as a member of the organization. You can find the scripts to replicate the database in the Scripts folder, along with the 3 queries that provide interesting or key information about the election.

The 3 node types are described as such:

## Queries

#### List Election Winners and Their Respective Constituencies
This query retrieves each constituency and their new representatives.
```cypher
MATCH (c:CANDIDATE {outcome : "won"}), (C:CONSTITUENCY)
WHERE c.constituency = C.name
RETURN c, C;
```

#### Show the Constituency with the Lowest Turnout Rate
This query will return the constituency with the lowest turnout rate.
```cypher
MATCH (c:CONSTITUENCY)
WITH min((toFloat(c.turnout) / toFloat(c.electors)) * 100) as m
MATCH (C:CONSTITUENCY)
WHERE ((toFloat(C.turnout) / toFloat(C.electors)) * 100) = m
RETURN C, m;
```
Alternatively the Constituency with the highest turnout rate can be displayed by changing the min function to a max function on line 2 of the query.

```cypher
MATCH (c:CONSTITUENCY)
WITH max((toFloat(c.turnout) / toFloat(c.electors)) * 100) as m
MATCH (C:CONSTITUENCY)
WHERE ((toFloat(C.turnout) / toFloat(C.electors)) * 100) = m
RETURN C, m;
```

#### Display Every Outgoing(Incumbent) Candidate Who Lost Their Seat
This query will list every representative that was challenged and defeated in the election.
```cypher
MATCH (C :OUTGOING{outcome:"lost"}), (c :CONSTITUENCY)
WHERE C.constituency = c.name
return C, c
```
